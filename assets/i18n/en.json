Throughout my career, I have gained extensive experience in various languages and technologies, enabling me to design, improve, and troubleshoot a variety of projects. \n \nIn the field of web development, I have worked with cutting-edge technologies such as TypeScript in Angular and Node.js with JavaScript, where I have developed both the frontend and backend of complex web applications. I also have experience using ASP.NET and PHP to create robust and scalable web solutions. \n \nAdditionally, I have ventured into desktop application development using .NET Framework and C#, providing customized and efficient solutions for various business needs. I have also developed APIs using these same technologies to facilitate integration between different systems. \n \nMy experience also includes database management, especially in SQL Server environments, where I have designed and managed efficient and secure databases to support web and desktop applications. \n \nI am constantly seeking exciting challenges and opportunities to expand my skills while contributing to the success of innovative projects. I look forward to collaborating with you on your next project!",
